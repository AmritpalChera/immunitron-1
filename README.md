Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

There are 2 models working together.

The first model is used for object classifications, where you can train the model live on different sets of data.

The second model is pre-trained to segment body parts. It will run out-of-the-box even without the classification functionality.

### Steps to run the code
1. Enable camera
2. Gather data for class 1
3. Stop Gathering data
4. Gather data for class 2
5. Stop gathering data
6. Predict and train model
